== Description ==

ImmerStat places a .PNG in the top-right corner of your admin screen with your current WordPress.com pageview statistics.  The graphic is provided using the Google Charts API.

It also removes the WordPress.com Stats panel from the dashboard.  If you want to see all the information that WordPress.com Stats provides, you can still go to that subpage.  Your dashboard no longer has any Flash elements on it!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `immerstat` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
